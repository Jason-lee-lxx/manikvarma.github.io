We question the role that large scale filter banks have
traditionally played in texture classification. It is demonstrated
that textures can be classified using the joint distribution of
intensity values over extremely compact neighbourhoods (starting from
as small as $3\times 3$ pixels square), and that this outperforms
classification using filter banks with large support.

We develop a novel texton based representation which is suited to
modelling this joint neighbourhood distribution for MRFs.  The
representation is learnt from training images, and then used to
classify novel images (with unknown viewpoint and lighting) into
texture classes.

The power of the method is demonstrated by classifying over 2800
images of all 61 textures present in the Columbia-Utrecht database.
The classification performance surpasses that of recent
state-of-the-art filter bank based classifiers such as Leung & Malik
[IJCV 01], Cula & Dana [CVPR 01], and Varma & Zisserman [ECCV 02].
