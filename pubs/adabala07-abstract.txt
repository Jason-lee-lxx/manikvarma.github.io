Geographic maps have existed from early stages of human
civilization. Various styles of visualizing the geographic information
have evolved depending on the nature of information and the technology
available for visualization. This has led to innumerable map
styles. In this work we develop a technique to create maps by
combining two-dimensional and three-dimensions information such that
the resulting maps are both functional and aesthetically
appealing. Our technique requires geographical information in vector
form and aerial images as inputs. We use computer vision based
approaches and user defined inputs to augment the vector data with
information that is required to create stylized maps. We define
procedural graphics methods to generate a range of geographic elements
that can be composed together into a stylized map. We demonstrate our
technique by generating example maps of a region in Las Vegas.
