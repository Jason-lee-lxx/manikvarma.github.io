<p>
The objective in extreme multi-label learning is to learn a classifier that can automatically tag a datapoint with the most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label space. FastXML is an efficient tree ensemble based extreme classifier that can scale to millions of labels. FastXML can be trained on most datasets using a desktop/small cluster and can make predictions in milliseconds per test point. Tree ensembles generally require a lot of RAM and FastXML is no exception.

<p>
The code for FastXML is written in C++ and should compile on 64 bit Windows/Linux machines using a C++11 enabled compiler. Matlab wrappers have also been provided with the code. Installation and usage instructions are provided below and in Readme.txt. The default parameters provided in the Usage Section work reasonably on the benchmark datasets in the <a href="../../downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html">Extreme Classification Repository</a>.

<h2>Experimental Results and Datasets</h2>

<p>
Please visit the <a href="../../downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html">Extreme Classification Repository</a> to download the benchmark datasets and compare FastXML's performance to baseline algorithms. 
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

Linux/Windows makefiles for compiling FastXML have been provided with the source code. To compile, run "make" (Linux) or "nmake -f Makefile.win" (Windows) in the FastXML folder.
Run the following commands from inside the FastXML folder for training and testing.		<br><br>

<h3>Training</h3>

C++: 
<pre>	./fastXML_train [feature file name] [label file name] [model folder name] -S 0 -T 1 -s 0 -t 50 -b 1.0 -c 1.0 -m 10 -l 10 </pre>

Matlab:
<pre>	fastXML_train([feature matrix], [label matrix], param, [model folder name])</pre>

where:
<pre>
	-T &equiv; param.num_thread		: Number of threads to use										default=1
	-s &equiv; param.start_tree		: Starting tree index											default=0
	-t &equiv; param.num_tree		: Number of trees to be grown										default=50
	-b &equiv; param.bias			: Feature bias value, extra feature value to be appended						default=1.0
	-c &equiv; param.log_loss_coeff	: SVM weight co-efficient										default=1.0
	-l &equiv; param.lbl_per_leaf		: Number of label-probability pairs to retain in a leaf							default=100
	-m &equiv; param.max_leaf		: Maximum allowed instances in a leaf node. Larger nodes are attempted to be split, and on failure converted to leaves		default=10
</pre>

<h3>Testing</h3>

C++: 
<pre>	./fastXML_test [feature file name] [score file name] [model folder name] T 1 -s 0 -t 50</pre>

Matlab:
<pre>	[score matrix] = fastXML_test([feature matrix], param, [model folder name])</pre>

where:
<pre>
	-T &equiv; param.num_thread		: same as in training											default=[value saved in trained model]
	-s &equiv; param.start_tree		: same as in training											default=[value saved in trained model]
	-t &equiv; param.num_tree		: same as in training											default=[value saved in trained model]
</pre>

<h3>Performance Evaluation</h3>

Scripts for performance evaluation are only available in Matlab. To compile these scripts, execute "make" in the Tools folder from the Matlab terminal.<br>
Following command is executed from Tools/metrics folder and outputs a struct containing all the metrics:
<pre>	[metrics] = get_all_metrics([test score matrix], [test label matrix], [inverse label propensity vector])</pre>

<h3> Miscellaneous </h3>

<ul>
<li>
The data format required by FastXML for feature and label input files is different from the format used in the <a href="../../downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html">repository</a> datasets.
To convert from the repository format to FastXML format, run the following command from the 'Tools' folder:
<pre>	perl convert_format.pl [repository data file] [output feature file name] [output label file name] </pre>
</li>

<li>
Scripts are provided in the 'Tools' folder for sparse matrix inter conversion between Matlab .mat format and text format.<br>
To read a text matrix into Matlab:
<pre>	[matrix] = read_text_mat([text matrix name]); </pre>
To write a Matlab matrix into text format:
<pre>	write_text_mat([Matlab sparse matrix], [text matrix name to be written to]);</pre>
</li>

<li>
To generate inverse label propensity weights, run the following command inside 'Tools/metrics' folder on Matlab terminal:
<pre>	[weights vector] = inv_propensity([training label matrix],A,B); </pre>
A,B are the parameters of the inverse propensity model. Following values are to be used over the benchmark datasets:

<pre>
	Wikipedia-LSHTC: A=0.5,  B=0.4
	Amazon:          A=0.6,  B=2.6
	Other:		 A=0.55, B=1.5
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Toy Example</h2>

The zip file containing the source code also includes the EUR-Lex dataset as a toy example. To run FastXML on the EUR-Lex dataset, execute "bash sample_run.sh" (Linux) or "sample_run" (Windows) in the FastXML folder.<br>
