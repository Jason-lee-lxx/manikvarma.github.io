The objective in Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) is to jointly learn
both kernel and SVM parameters. We focus on the case where the kernel
is learnt to be a linear combination of given base kernels with
non-negative weights. The kernel weights are regularised using
the <i>p</i>-norm where <i>p</i> is strictly greater than one. Choose
values of <i>p</i> close to one, such as 1.1 or 1.33, if you'd like to
learn sparse linear kernel combinations. The formulation can also
handle certain Bregman divergences.
</p>

<p>
The following is very efficient code for training <i>p</i>-norm MKL
using Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO). The code has been built
on top of the LibSVM code base and therefore has very similar
usage. Please go through the included README file for detailed usage
instructions as well as the LibSVM FAQ and COPYRIGHT. Using standard
hardware, our code can be used to train on Sonar with a hundred
thousand kernels in less than seven minutes for pre-computed RBF
kernels and in less than thirty minutes for kernels computed on the
fly. Similarly, training on the Adult data set with fifty thousand
training points and fifty kernels computed on the fly takes less than
half an hour.

<p>
The code is in C++ and should compile on 32/64 bit Windows/Linux
machines. This code is made available as is for non-commercial
research purposes. Please contact Manik Varma [manik@microsoft.com] and
S. V. N. Vishwanathan [vishy@stat.purdue.edu] if you have any
questions or feedback.
