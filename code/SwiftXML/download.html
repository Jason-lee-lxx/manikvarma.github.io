	The objective in extreme multi-label learning is to build classifiers that can annotate a data point with the subset of relevant labels from an extremely large label set. Extreme classification has, thus far, only been studied in the context of predicting labels for novel test points. SwiftXML is useful for solving extreme classification problem when predictions need to be made on training points with partially revealed labels. This allows the reformulation of warm-start tagging, ranking and recommendation problems as extreme multi-label learning with each item to be ranked/recommended being mapped onto a separate label. SwiftXML can be significantly more accurate as compared to leading extreme classifiers such as FastXML and PfastreXML as well as compared to classical recommendation algorithms on warm-start extreme classification tasks. Please refer to the research paper <a href="#WSDM18">[1]</a> for more details.

	<h2>Experimental Results and Datasets</h2>

	<p>
		Please visit the <a href="../../downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html">Extreme Classification Repository</a> to download the benchmark datasets and compare SwiftXML's performance to baseline algorithms. Please download the label (or item) features for the benchmark datasets on the Repository as well as user features and labels for new benchmark datasets used in the paper from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jp208zhmq5trmxh/Item_Features.zip?dl=0">here</a>. For more information about item features, please refer to the research paper.
	</p>

	<h2>Usage</h2>

		Linux/Windows makefiles for compiling SwiftXML have been provided with the source code. To compile, run "make" (Linux) or "nmake -f Makefile.win" (Windows) in the SwiftXML folder.
		Run the following commands from inside the SwiftXML folder for training and testing.<br><br>


	<h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
Prior to training and prediction, the data needs to be preprocessed into format accepted by SwiftXML. Preprocessing comprises the following steps
<ul>
<li> Download the data point (user) features and the ground truth labels from the Extreme Classification Repository</li>
<li> Download the label (item) features from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jp208zhmq5trmxh/Item_Features.zip?dl=0">here</a> and place it in the dataset's folder. For new datasets, user features and labels are also provided with the zip file</li>
<li> Set the file names, fraction of revealed labels ("frac") and the parameters of the inverse propensity model for the given dataset ("A" and "B") appropriately in sample_run.sh</li>
<li> Run swiftXML_preprocess_data.m in Matlab as shown in the example in sample_run.sh. This script creates user and item features and labels in the format expected by SwiftXML</li>
</ul>

Following files are expected by SwiftXML and are created by swiftXML_preprocess_data.m:
<pre>trn_X_Xf.txt, trn_X_Y.txt, trn_item_X_Xf.txt, tst_X_Xf.txt, inc_tst_X_Y.txt, exc_tst_X_Y.txt, tst_item_X_Xf.txt, inv_prop.txt</pre>

Preprocessing requires <a href="https://www.perl.org/get.html">Perl</a> and <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/downloads">Matlab</a>.

Please refer to sample_run.sh/sample_run.bat for better understanding.

	<h3>Training</h3>

	C++:
        <pre>./swiftXML_train [user feature file name] [item feature file name] [label file name] [inverse propensity file name] [model folder name] -S 0 -T 1 -s 0 -t 50 -b 1.0 -c 1.0 -m 10 -l 100 -g 30 -a 0.8 -q 1 -N [number of original training points]</pre>

	Matlab:
        <pre>swiftXML_train([user feature matrix], [item feature matrix], [input label matrix], [inverse propensity score vector], [output model folder name], param);</pre>

where:
<pre>
	-S = param.pfswitch				: PfastXML switch, setting this to 1 omits tail classifiers, thus leading to PfastXML algorithm. default=0
	-T = param.num_thread			: Number of threads to use. default=1
	-s = param.start_tree			: Starting tree index. default=0
	-t = param.num_tree				: Number of trees to be grown. default=50
	-b = param.bias					: Feature bias value, extre feature value to be appended. default=1.0
	-c = param.log_loss_coeff		: log-loss weight co-efficient for separator in user feature space. default=1.0
	-m = param.max_leaf				: Maximum allowed instances in a leaf node. Larger nodes are attempted to be split, and on failure converted to leaves. default=10
	-l = param.lbl_per_leaf			: Number of label-probability pairs to retain in a leaf. default=100
	-g = param.gamma				: gamma parameter appearing in tail label classifiers. default=30
	-a = param.alpha				: Trade-off parameter between PfastXML and tail label classifiers. default=0.8
	-q = param.quiet				: Quiet option (0/1). default=0
	-ic = param.item_log_loss_coeff	: Log-loss weight co-efficient for separator in item feature space. default=1.0
	-f = param.feat_imp				: Relative importance of user and item feature separators during classification. default=0.5
	-N = param.num_trn_X			: Number of original training instances in dataset. Note that test points are also used during training and are not counted here.
</pre>
	The fine-tuned hyperparameter settings for the benchmark datasets used in the <a href="#WSDM18">[1]</a> are available from "hyperparameters.txt" file in the SwiftXML's code folder. For C++, the feature and label input files are expected to be in sparse matrix text format (refer to Miscellaneous section). For Matlab, the feature and label matrices are Matlab's sparse matrices.

	<h3>Testing</h3>

	C++:
	<pre>./swiftXML_test [user feature file name] [item feature file name] [score file name] [model folder name] -S 0 -T 1 -s 0 -t 50 -n 1000 -q 1</pre>

	Matlab:
    <pre>output_score_mat = parabel_predict( [user feature file name], [item feature file name], [input model folder name], param );</pre>

	where:
	<pre>
	-S = param.pfswitch				: PfastXML switch, setting this to 1 omits tail classifiers, thus leading to PfastXML algorithm. default=[value saved in trained model]
