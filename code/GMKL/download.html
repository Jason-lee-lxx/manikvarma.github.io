<center><h1><b>Generalized Multiple Kernel Learning Code</b></h1></center>

<p> 
The following code will learn general kernel combinations based on
gradient descent optimization and standard SVM solvers. The code is in
Matlab and uses <a
href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/">LIBSVM</a> as the
internal SVM solver. The code is quite flexible and you can plug in
your own kernel function and regularizer. I've included examples of
functions to compute sums and products of base kernels subject to
l<sub>1</sub> or l<sub>2</sub> regularization. It is also possible to
use precomputed base kernel matrices. The code computes a common set
of kernel parameters across the entire training data set. It is fairly
straight forward to modify the code to compute a different set of
kernel parameters per training data point.

<p>
The function for performing gradient descent is COMPGDoptimize.m while
GMKLwrapper.m shows how to call the function. Please go through the
comments in both files before running the code. By setting the
parameters in GMKLwrapper you can tackle various problems such as
classification, regression, <i>etc</i>.

This code is made available as is for non-commercial research
purposes. Please make sure you go through the licenses. The LIBSVM
source has been modified to return the value of the objective function
at the optiumum.
